# How to Setup linux module to measure network packets

1. Set up a hook in the networking stack using the netfilter framework. You can use the nf_register_hook() function to register a hook that intercepts incoming and outgoing packets. This function takes a pointer to a struct nf_hook_ops structure that defines the hook's behavior.

2. In the hook function, extract the arrival time of the packet using the ktime_get() function, which returns the current system time with nanosecond precision.

3. Modify the packet in some way if necessary (e.g., adding a custom header) and then return an appropriate value to allow the packet to continue through the networking stack.

4. When the packet is ready to be transmitted, set up another hook to intercept the outgoing packet and extract the departure time using ktime_get() once again.

5. Use the extracted arrival and departure times to calculate the packet's latency, processing time, or other relevant metrics, and store them as desired (e.g., in a circular buffer or a log file).
