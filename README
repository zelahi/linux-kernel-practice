## Network Driver Test

## Installation Requirements

Since I have a M1 laptop I had to setup [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html).
This was the only virtualization software I could find that works on a m1 laptop.

1. Download and setup VMWare Fusion here: [VmWare](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html)
2. Download the ubuntu iso: [Ubuntu Iso Download](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/)
3. Follow the instructions for VmWare Fusion to setup a Ubuntu VM

### Loading a Linux Module

1. I have a `test.c` which I use to learn how to load a kernal module into a VM
2. Run the Makefile command: `make all`
3. Load the module: `sudo insmod test.ko`
4. View the cmd in the kernal using: `dmesg`
5. Remove the module: `sudo rmmod test.ko`
5. Run `dmesg` and Verify we see a `Goodbye` message
